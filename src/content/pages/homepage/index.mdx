Hi, I'm Alviyan (iian). I'm a Backend Engineer with 4+ years building scalable systems using Go and JavaScript. By day, I craft robust APIs and backend solutions. By night, I raise Muscovy ducks and chickens.

I specialize in high-performance systems with clean architecture and efficient data processing. When not coding, I'm exploring how technology can improve traditional farming practices.

Let's connect and collaborate on backend projects or discuss sustainable farming! ðŸ§¡
